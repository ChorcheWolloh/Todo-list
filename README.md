# Todo-list

First personal project. To-do web application using vanilla CSS and JS, that allows user to store their bullet points in the local storage.

Additional features:
  - Interactive calendar that allows user to choose for which day they are writing to-do list;
  - Visually pleasing progress bar that tracks how much of the bullet points are completed.
